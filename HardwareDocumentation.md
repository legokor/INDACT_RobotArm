This document describes the hardware aspect (mechanical construction, power distribution and control circuitry) of the industrial robot arm (nicknamed "Karcsi") made by the INDACT project of LEGO KÃ¶r.

# Mechanical construction

> TODO complete this section with mCAD models and diagrams

The robot arm is constructed from extruded aluminium bars, machined stainless steel plates, aluminium spacer rods, and held together with screws. A vertical profile and a paralel ball screw are mounted on a rotary base, forming the Z axis of the arm's movement. A carriage riding on this profile is connected to another, horizontal profile, which forms the R axis. The end-effector, currently a 3D-printed mechanical hand with 5 fingers, is attached to one end of the R axis profile.

The base enables rotary movement (Phi axis), realised by a stepper motor and belt-drive. The Z axis movement is realised by a stepper motor, mounted at the upper end of the Z axis profile, driving the ball screw. The R axis movement is realised by a stepper motor mounted on the carriage, driving a studded belt fastened to the R axis profile, similarly to how cheap laser-engravers move. The movement of the fingers is realised by 3 servos inside the palm section of the hand assembly.

We plan to extend the arm's movement capabilities by introducing up to 3 more degrees of freedom through a wrist assembly that would enable tilting and rotation (Theta axis) of the end-effector.

# Power distribution

The arm is powered from the European power grid (single-phase 230V 50Hz) through the control cabinet. This cabinet is equipped with a RCD, circuit breaker, mains switch, and 3 separate, galvanically isolated switch-mode AC-to-DC power supplies:

* PSU1 supplies +24V DC to the stepper motor drivers, is sized to continuously withstand the high currents the motors draw, and wired directly to the motor drivers in the control cabinet.

* PSU2 supplies +24V DC to the control electronics, for long distance signal wiring, powering a cooling fan, and optical isolation. This 24V power line is routed through the main control board and auxiliary control board. The auxiliary control board creates its own 5V power with a switch-mode 24VDC-to-5VDC Buck converter.

* PSU3 supplies +5V DC to the control electronics, to power digital control and measurement circuitry. This 5V power line is routed through the main control board. The main control board creates 3.3V for logic-level circuitry with a 5V-to-3V3 Low-Dropout linear regulator (LDO).

The Emergency Stop (ESTOP) button breaks both 24V lines, but not 5V, so the ESTOP event can be logged by the control logic.

The diagram below shows how power is distributed.

# Control and data flow

The arm is controlled and programmed through ROS, the Robot Operating System, running on a PC, connected to the arm by an Ethernet link. Low-level control is performed by an STM32F7 microcontroller, residing on a Nucle-F7 development board conencted to the main control board by pinheaders. The specific microcontroller and development board were chosen due to ROS and Ethernet support, and part availability considerations. The Nucleo has the Ethernet interface built-in.

Additionally, direct movement control is possible via a remote, connected over Wifi to the arm. The Wifi module is connected to the microcontroller via an UART link and additional control signals (CH-PD, Reset, and 2 GPIO pins, one pulled up and one driving a Wifi indicator LED), and receives 3.3V power from the main control board.

Direct movement control is also possible through a locally connected interface (one pushbutton for each direction of each axis, 6 to 18 in total) located inside the control cabinet, for testing and debugging purposes, and as backup in case ROS and Wifi both fail.

The arm is equipped with limit switches on all axes, and additional position sensing gates on the Z and R axes. The stepper motors for the R, Z, Phi and Theta axes are equipped with rotary encoders to provide feedback about their movement. A temperature sensor measures the internal temperature of the control cabinet. A microswitch or hall-effect sensor detects whether the control cabinet is open.

The stepper motors of the axes are controlled via motor drivers, located in the control cabinet. The microcontroller controls the motor drivers through 3 wires each: PUL, DIR, ENA (COM is passed along as a 4th reference wire). The motors perform one step for each pulse on PUL, in the direction specified via DIR, if ENA is pulled high.

The servos in the end-effector communicate with the microcontroller directly over 3-wire interfaces. The control cabinet cooling fan is PWM controlled by the microcontroller, driven by a MOSFET.

The Emergency Stop (ESTOP) industrial emergency stop button (push to engage, turn to reset) breaks both 24V power lines, but 5V power remains online, and an ESTOP signal is sent to the microcontroller (one pin is pulled low), so the system can log ESTOP events.

The microcontroller displays status messages, error codes and other information on a 2-by-15 character LCD display visible from outside the control cabinet through a window. The display uses a 11-wire interface (including 3.3V power and COM) to communicate with the microcontroller.

For intercompatibility with other end-effectors in the future, a MODBUS (TIA/EIA-485) link is provided from the microcontroller to the auxiliary control board. The MODBUS link is a duplex differential link, optically isolated and terminated on both ends, using 5V line levels.

An additional SPI 4-wire interface is present on the Main Control Board for future expansion.

The Nucleo, display, temperature sensor, cooling fan, motor drivers, Wifi module, Main Control Board, and all power supplies and mains-voltage devices are located in the control cabinet. The stepper motors are connected directly to the motor drivers. The limit switches, position sensing gates, encoders, end-effector servos, and the MODBUS interface are wired through the Auxiliary Control Board, located on the R axis profile near the end-effector. The driver cables for the Z and R axis motors (as well as the planned wrist rotation and tilt motors), 24V power, the MODBUS (TIA/EIA-485) impedance-controlled differential trunk cable, the end-effector servo wires, and the wires for the encoders, limit switches and position sensing gates, together form the Spinal Cable of the arm, encased in plastic wire-guarding worms along the Z and R axes.

The connections for the limit switches, encoders, servos and position sensing gates are all optically isolated on both ends, and use 24V signa-levels to reduce attenuation over longer distances. The optocouplers and 24V drivers are located on the Main Control Board and Auxiliary Control Board.

The diagram below shows how control signals and peripherals are connected.

[^1]: The Phi axis encoder is not wired through the Aux. Control Board.

Filtering and decoupling capacitors, oscillators, etc. are built into the Nucleo board for the STM32. An RC Reset circuit, power decoupling capacitor, a pull-up resistor on GPIO0, and a status LED with series resistor on GPIO2 are required for the Wifi module. Decoupling capacitor is recommended for the display, as well as the temperature sensor. For all digital inputs, internal pullup is required (configurable in STM32 CubeIDE). The N-channel MOSFET driving the cooling fan requires a Gate resistor to prevent it from overloading the STM32 GPIO pins while switching. The MODBUS connection requires termination on both ends, pull-up and pull-down resistors on the Main Control Board, and differential, isolated line-drivers and receivers for both connections. The display needs a trimmer potetntiometer with the ends between 5V and COM and the wiper conneted to pin 3 to set the contrast, as well as a MOSFET (and accompanying Gate resistor) and series resistor to drive its backlight LED.

Optocouplers referred to as Output Optocouplers are driven by 3.3V logic-level GPIO pins, have to withstand 24V on their outputs, and have to reliably switch at several hundred kHz of frequency.
Optocouplers referred to as Input Optocouplers have to withstand being driven by 24V signals, provide 3.3V logic-level outputs, and have to reliably switch at several hundred kHz of frequency.

Servo outputs require Output Optocouplers on the Main Control Board, and Input Optocouplers on the Aux. Control Board.
Limit switches, position sensing gates and encoders require Input Optocouplers on the Main Control Board, and Output Optocouplers on the Aux. Control Board. For the encoders, high-speed optos are required.
Optically isolating the MODBUS link is optional.

Both the Main Control Board and Aux. Control Board have LEDs to indicate power-on state.

For connections between the Main Control Board, Aux. Control Board, and other parts, the Molex ... connector is used.
