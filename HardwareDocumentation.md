***

This document describes the hardware aspect (mechanical construction, power distribution and control circuitry) of the industrial robot arm (nicknamed "Karcsi") made by the INDACT project of LEGO KÃ¶r.

# Mechanical construction

> TODO complete this section with mCAD models and diagrams

The robot arm is constructed from extruded aluminium bars, machined stainless steel plates, aluminium spacer rods, and held together with screws. A vertical profile and a paralel ball screw are mounted on a rotary base, forming the **Z axis** of the arm's movement. A carriage riding on this profile is connected to another, horizontal profile, which forms the **R axis**. The end-effector, currently a 3D-printed mechanical hand with 5 fingers, is attached to one end of the R axis profile.

The base enables rotary movement (**Phi axis**), realised by a stepper motor and belt-drive. The Z axis movement is realised by a stepper motor, mounted at the upper end of the Z axis profile, driving the ball screw. The R axis movement is realised by a stepper motor mounted on the carriage, driving a studded belt fastened to the R axis profile, similarly to how cheap laser-engravers move. The movement of the fingers is realised by 3 servos inside the palm section of the hand assembly.

We plan to extend the arm's movement capabilities by introducing up to 3 more degrees of freedom through a wrist assembly that would enable tilting (Alpha, Beta axes) and rotation (Theta axis) of the end-effector.

# Power distribution

The arm is powered from the European power grid (**single-phase 230V 50Hz AC**) through the Electronics Box. This cabinet is equipped with a RCD, circuit breaker, mains switch, and 3 separate, galvanically isolated switch-mode AC-to-DC power supplies:

* **PSU1** supplies +24V DC to the stepper motor drivers, is sized to continuously withstand the high currents the motors draw, and wired directly to the motor drivers in the Electronics Box.
* **PSU2** supplies +24V DC to the control electronics, for long distance signal wiring, powering a cooling fan, and optical isolation. This 24V power line is routed through the Main Control Board and auxiliary control boards. The auxiliary control boards create their own 5V power with switch-mode 24VDC-to-5VDC Buck converters.
* **PSU3** supplies +5V DC to the control electronics, to power digital control and measurement circuitry. This 5V power line is routed through the Main Control Board. The Main Control Board creates a 3.3V supply rail for logic-level circuitry with a 5V-to-3V3 Low-Dropout linear regulator (LDO).

The **Emergency Stop** (ESTOP) button breaks the PSU1 24V circuit, but not 5V, so the ESTOP event can be logged by the control logic.

The diagram below shows how power is distributed.

# Control and data flow

## The main microcontroller

The arm is mainly controlled and programmed through **ROS** (the Robot Operating System) running on a PC connected via Ethernet. Direct control is possible from a remote connected over Wifi, or a wired remote (for debugging and tesing purposes).

An **STM32F7**46ZG microcontroller running **micro-ROS** firmware (located on a **Nucleo-F746** development board, connected to the Main Control Board via pin headers) performs low-level control and telemetry data collection:

* Communicates with the **PC over Ethernet**
* Controls the **motor drivers** for the Phi, R, Z (and optionally Theta) axes
* Controls the current, hand-like  **end-effector's servos**
* Measures and reports the movement speed and position of the arm, through **limit switches, position sensing gates and motor encoders**
* Communicates with the Wifi remote through an **ESP-01 Wifi module**
* Handles **Emergency Stop** events, the **Electronics Box being opened** during operation, or a limit switch being triggered, and stops the arm according to the given rules
* Regulates the temperature of the Electronics Box through a **fan and a temperature sensor**
* Communicates with any future smart end-effector over **MODBUS** (TIA/EIA-485)
* Handles the **wired remote**
* Displays status and error messages on a 2x16 **character lCD**
* Provides additional expansion capability through **SPI and GPIO** ports

The specific microcontroller and development board were chosen due to ROS and Ethernet support, and part availability considerations.

Detailed information (including datasheet) about the microcontroller can be found [here](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32f746zg.html#documentation "STM32F746 documentation"). Documentation for the Nucleo-F746 development board can be found [here](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f746zg.html#documentation "Nucleo documentation").

## Peripherals

* The STM32F7 microcontroller can only read 4 separate encoders, so for complete and precise control in 6 degrees of freedom, an additional Cortex-M0-based, smaller microcontroller may be soldered directly to the Main Control Board, to extend the timer capabilities of the Nucleo, and thus control the planned **Alpha, Beta and Theta axes**, and report back their position and speed. This microcontroller communicates with the Nucleo over SPI. The exact model of this microcontroller is TBD.
* The Wifi remote connects over Wifi to an ESP-01 Wifi module, connected to the Nucleo over a full-duplex serial (UART) connection (and 4 additional GPIO control signals).
* The wired remote features one pushbutton for each direction of each axis and servo, up to 18 in total, pulling a corresponding GPIO input to ground.
* All axes feature limit switches to prevent movement outside the safe operating movement range. These are all connected to correspoding GPIO pins.
* Some axes feature additional position sensing gates to aid the robot in determining its position. These are all connected to corresponding GPIO pins.
* The Nucleo development board features built-in Ethernet and USB-OTG connectivity, 3 programmable LED outputs, 2 pushbutton inputs, and JTAG and ST-LINK programming interfaces.
* Each axis requires a motor driver (located in the Electronics Box), which are controlled with Step, Direction and Enable signals for each. Direction and Enable signals are simple GPIO outputs, but Step signals need to be generated with timers, preferably a separate timer for each axis. The steper motors connect directly to the motor drivers.
* The 3 servos of the end-effector are controlled by PWM signals, one each. These can be from the same timer.
* All axes feature encoders to accurately measure the rotational speed and angle of the motors. These require 2 channels of an encoder-compatible timer each.
* The Electronics Box cooling fan is PWM-controlled through a MOSFET, and thus requires one channel of any one timer.
* The character LCD module is connected to the Nucleo over a 11-pin paralel GPIO interface, and its backlight LED is PWM-controlled through a MOSFET (also reuiring one channel of any one timer).
* The Electronics Box internal temperature is measured with a BME-280 temperature sensor, connected to the Nucleo over I2C.
* The ESTOP button, and the switch detecting the Electronics Box being open, both pull one GPIO pin each to ground.
* For intercompatibility with future smart end-effectors, a MODBUS (TIA/EIA-485, full-duplex differential UART) link is provided from the Nucleo.

For better signal integrity, electrical safety, reliability and ESD-protection, all low-current signals travelling long distances (encoders, position sensing gates, limit switches, end-effector servos) are optically isolated on both ends, and shifted to 24V levels.
The MODBUS link does not require optical isolation, as it uses a shielded, impedance-controlled, duplex differential twisted pair trunk cable terminated on both ends, operating at 5V line levels, and all devices on it connect via line driver buffers. This works well in the industry for distances over kilometers long, and rather noisy environments. More info can be found [here](https://modbus.org/docs/Modbus_over_serial_line_V1_02.pdf "MODBUS over Serial documentation")

The diagram below shows how control signals and peripherals are connected.
